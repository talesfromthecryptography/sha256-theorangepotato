# SHA256

Here are the .h and stub .c files for sha256.

Here's what you need to do.

1. Look at comments in the .c file for instructions on completing the implementation.
2. Implement a test_sha256.c that includes a main() function that can be used to test your implementation.

The best thing for (2) is to implement a program that hashes the contents of a file given as a command line argument. That way you can easily compare your implementation to known implementations.
